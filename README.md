# Event Management System

## Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Event Management System project, designed for managing various types of events. The system utilizes Python for backend development and MongoDB as a NoSQL database to handle data storage efficiently. This project is structured to meet specific user stories, integrate a component diagram, include thorough documentation, and provide source code management through Git with development in feature branches.

### **Project Components**

1. **User Stories**
   - As an event organizer, I want to create, edit, and delete event entries so that I can manage events easily.
   - As a participant, I want to search for events by title, description, or location so that I can find events of interest.
   - As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback on the inputs I provide to ensure the data is correct.

2. **Component Diagram**
   - Outline the architecture of the system including client, server, and database connectivity.

3. **Project Description**
   - A web-based application that allows users to manage and participate in events. It includes features such as CRUD operations, full-text search, transaction handling, and data analysis.

4. **Source Code Management**
   - All source code will be hosted on a Git repository, with development segmented into feature branches.

5. **No Redundancy in Code**
   - Code modularization to avoid redundancy, ensuring reusability and maintainability.

6. **Parameterized Values**
   - All values will be parameterized to avoid hard-coding within the application, promoting flexibility and security.

7. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between the database queries and business logic to maintain a clean code architecture.

8. **Exception Handling**
   - Comprehensive exception handling to manage errors gracefully and provide a robust user experience.

9. **Schema Validation**
   - Implement schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

#### **Application Features**

1. **User Interface**
   - Interactive GUI created with Angular or Vue, designed for a seamless user experience.
   - Input validation and user feedback, such as warnings for incomplete forms.

2. **Transaction Handling**
   - Robust transaction management to ensure data consistency, especially during booking or registration processes.

3. **CRUD Operations**
   - Allow users to create, read, update, and delete event data effectively.

4. **Full-Text Search**
   - Implement full-text search capabilities to facilitate the easy retrieval of events.

5. **Data Analysis**
   - Minimum of three analytical functions to provide insights, such as the number of participants per event, most popular events, and event categorization.

6. **Reporting**
   - Generate reports based on user activities and event analytics.

### **Implementation Tips**

- **Planning**: Begin by mapping out the data models and endpoints for the CRUD operations.
- **Documentation**: Maintain continuous documentation throughout the development process, especially when making key decisions or changes.
- **Testing**: Implement thorough testing protocols, including unit and integration tests, to ensure all functionalities work as intended.
- **Version Control**: Use Git branches efficiently to manage features and integrate changes, maintaining a clean master branch.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively manage and execute your Event Management System project, ensuring it meets all specified requirements and user needs.
